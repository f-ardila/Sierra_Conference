									<h1>History of the Sierra Conference</h1>
									<p>According to UC Astronomy lore, many years ago there existed an inter-campus gathering of graduate students known as the Sierra Conference...</p>

						<h2>The early days</h2>
						The very first Sierra Conference was in 1968 and the original founders include ­Lawrence Anderson, Priscilla Frisch, and Richard Treffers, who were graduate students at UC Berkeley at the time.<br><br>

						Lawrence shared some of what he remembered from that time:<br>

						"The main concerns were setting up the talks, inviting speakers (who came mostly from California and Arizona, but there were a few visiting scholars too), reserving the campsite, and then planning menus. The first conference was in 1968 and I think we held one every year after that.<br>

						Here is a summary of a typical conference for ~50 to 70 people:<br>
						1) Most were held in the Tuolumne Meadows campground of Yosemite, although I think there were one or two in Kings Canyon and/or Sequoia.<br>
						2) They were five days long, with added weekend time for anyone who wanted to stay.<br>
						3) It was a tent­camping only site, so no RVs, etc. but you could park in an associated area.<br>
						4) We had one or two science talks in the morning, and one in the evening around a campfire. I don't think we had electricity,<br>
						so all presentations were blackboard/chalk or posterboard. We did have Coleman lanterns for added lighting in the evening.<br>
						5) There was a fee (I don't remember how much) out of which we supplied all meals for the five days. We did not pay speakers. I don't remember if we had any other funding, but we may have.<br>
						6) The meals were good! My wife and I and Richard and Donna Treffers made up quite sophisticated menus (grilled flank steak and other more perishables early on, reduced to spaghetti by friday). We built a giant insulated cooler (2x2x4') that held dry ice for most of the duration. We marinated the flank steaks in the car on the way from Berkeley. Bacon and eggs, etc. for breakfast, sandwich ingredients to take on the trail for lunch, and full course dinners. Attendees were responsible for their plates and utensils, but we had some extras. People took turns on cooking and cleaning up duties.<br>
						7) There were bears. On one memorable evening, Alan Sandage was giving a talk at the campfire­ he was facing all of us so did not see a bear come up behind the poster easel. But we did. We remained quiet until the bear came in front of the easel... (I may be exaggerating a bit here for effect)."<br><br>

						<h2>The Osterbrock revival</h2>
							<p>During the <a href="http://mthamilton.ucolick.org/EVENTS/2017/index.htm">2017 Observational Astronomy Workshop</a> at Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton, many of the attendees expressed interest in holding more inter-campus events to create more of a community with UC astronomy grads. The lore of the Sierra Conference was mentioned and it was decided that they would try to revive it. At exactly the same time, the <a href="https://www.astro.ucsc.edu/academics/Osterbrock/index.html">Donald and Irene Osterbrock Leadership Program</a> at UC Santa Cruz put out a call for proposals for its very first "mini-grants" projects. Thus, with the drive of these students and a successful proposal, the era of the Osterbrock Sierra Conference began.</p>
