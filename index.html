								<h2>FAQs</h2>
							</header>
							<ul>
								<li>Will there be any COVID-related protocols?</li>
								We are requiring that all participants be fully vaccinated (2 weeks after final shot) by the first day of the conference. We are adhering to the CDC recommendations that allow gatherings of fully vaccinated people. Given that the event is entirely outdoors, the risk of transmission would be low anyways.
								<li>Does it happen every year?</li>
								Ideally, yes, this is an annual event! But it takes time and effort from a dedicated organizing committee, so there have been years in the past where it did not take place. Most recently, it was held in 2018 and 2019.
								<li>What is the schedule like?</li>
								Usually we have a campsite booked from Thursday to Sunday. Thursday is the nominal arrival date, so there are no group events planned other than an icebreaking activity to meet everyone. Friday and Saturday are the main conference dates. In the mornings we have science presentations from attendees guided by booklets. Most of the day is open for recreational activities like hiking, swimming, rock climbing, relaxing, etc. depending on what people want to do. We meet back up at the campsite for dinner and then have our evening discussions, usually around the campfire. We discuss topics related to being a grad student in astronomy from the different perspectives of each campus and we plan out projects to collaborate on. Sunday is the departure day, so there is nothing planned. In 2021 we have an additional conference date (Thursday - Monday), so we are still working on finalizing the schedule, but it will be very similar.
								<li>I've never camped before, can I still go?</li>
								YES! There is usually a range in experience among attendees, from hardcore backpackers to first time campers. All are welcome and we can help you prepare however you need.
								<li>Will I have to pay?</li>
								Thanks to our sponsors, there is no registration fee and you do not have to pay for the conference itself. Additionally, there are some funds available to cover park entrance fees and help subsidize gas costs. However, costs for food and other supplies are not covered. Typically, attendees from a single campus will plan out meals and supplies together and split the costs. Some attendees have been successful in asking their department or grad student association for funds to help cover these expenses. This approach is highly encouraged! Feel free to reach out to the organizers if you have questions about this.

								<li>No one else from my campus is going, but I still want to attend!</li>
								Great! Nothing to worry about, this situation has happened in tha past. Definitely reach out to one of the organizers so that we know to expect you and can help you prepare and perhaps coordinate with another campus.

								<li>Can I bring my family / significant other?</li>
								While the general preference is for the conference to be grads only, we are willing to make exceptions. If your attendance is conditional on being able to bring a significant other / family, then we will definitely welcome them so that you can attend. We want to allow as many grads as possible to join. In the past we have had family members join us.
								<li>How can I get involved with organizing?</li>
								Reach out to your local campus point person and they can add you to our organizational google group!
								<li>What is the significance of <b>Osterbrock</b> in the name?</li>
								When the conference was revived in 2018, it was made possible by a grant provided the <a href="https://www.astro.ucsc.edu/academics/Osterbrock/index.html">Donald and Irene Osterbrock Leadership Program</a> at UC Santa Cruz. The program has continued to provide financial support for the conference in 2019 and 2021, and it has also been part of our name.
